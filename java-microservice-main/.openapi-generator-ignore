# OpenAPI Generator Ignore
# Generated by openapi-generator https://github.com/openapitools/openapi-generator

# Use this file to prevent files from being overwritten by the generator.
# The patterns follow closely to .gitignore or .dockerignore.

#ignore tests, we don't need to write unit tests for generated code, it defeats the purpose of using a generator
#src/test/java/com/opus2/microservice/client/*
#src/test/java/com/opus2/microservice/client/dto/*

#don't regenerate a pom.  This gets confusing as we are using gradle as our build tool
pom.xml

#Don't write over the top of our readme with a generated one.  We can add any additional info here as needed.

#Don't need this

#Don't need this extra file which just contains generator version, which can be gotten from build.gradle

#Don't need an extra copy of open api spec

#Don't override our custom .gitignore

#Since all code is generated to output directory, which we don't check in, avoid generating the whole src folder to avoid confusion
